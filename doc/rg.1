.PP
rg (ripgrep) combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack
clone) with the raw speed of grep.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-text
Search binary files as if they were text.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-count
Only show count of line matches for each file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-color \f[I]WHEN\f[]
Whether to use coloring in match.
Valid values are never, always or auto.
[default: auto]
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-regexp \f[I]PATTERN\f[] ...
Use PATTERN to search.
This option can be provided multiple times, where all patterns given are
searched.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-glob \f[I]GLOB\f[] ...
Include or exclude files for searching that match the given glob.
This always overrides any other ignore logic.
Multiple glob flags may be used.
Globbing rules match .gitignore globs.
Precede a glob with a \[aq]!\[aq] to exclude it.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show this usage message.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ignore\-case
Case insensitive search.
Overridden by \-\-case\-sensitive.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-line\-number
Show line numbers (1\-based).
This is enabled by default at a tty.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-line\-number
Suppress line numbers.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Do not print anything to stdout.
If a match is found in a file, stop searching that file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-replace \f[I]ARG\f[]
Replace every match with the string given.
Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-type \f[I]TYPE\f[] ...
Only search files matching TYPE.
Multiple type flags may be provided.
Use the \-\-type\-list flag to list all available types.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-type\-not \f[I]TYPE\f[] ...
Do not search files matching TYPE.
Multiple not\-type flags may be provided.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unrestricted ...
Reduce the level of \[aq]smart\[aq] searching.
A single \-u doesn\[aq]t respect .gitignore (etc.) files.
Two \-u flags will search hidden files and directories.
Three \-u flags will search binary files.
\-uu is equivalent to grep \-r, and \-uuu is equivalent to grep \-a \-r.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-invert\-match
Invert matching.
.RS
.RE
.TP
